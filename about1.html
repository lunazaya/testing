 <h1>About Us</h1>

 <p>Welcome to <strong>Bradley Valley Livestock and The Butcherâ€™s Pantry</strong> â€” where farm-fresh meets handcrafted quality. Weâ€™re a family-run operation proud to offer locally raised meats, baked goods, and confections that reflect our passion for sustainable and traditional food practices.</p>

 <p>Here you can order a range of our family-raised products from our farm in Forest Grove, BC. We offer our wide variety of meats, poultry and eggs via various methods, including direct to you from the farm, through our app, via the website, and the most exciting?! A storefront coming Spring 2026! We also offer delivery throughout BC. Are you interested in pre-purchasing as a gift to a family member? Pre-order and we will deliver to them for you, and if you want it to be a surprise, we love (delicious) surprises!</p>

 <p>Hopefully you find all the products you are looking for, and maybe even a little more ðŸ˜‰ If there is something that you are looking for, and you cannot find it, email or message us on our social media â€” chances are that it is already in the works, or we didnâ€™t think it would be popular enough to advertise. <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> We sell our meats by the pound. All pricing is listed per pound and for larger items such as roasts, actual cost will be weight dependant. In the comments you'll find more details on typical package sizing. Please add any special requests in the comments section (specific size, smoked, fresh/frozen â€” applicable to poultry only). Please reach out if you have any questions and be sure to follow us on Facebook or Instagram to see more about our farm.</p>

 <p>All of our animals are raised as free as they could be. This gives them a delicious taste, exceptional marbling, and as organic as possible. All feed is non-GMO and free of corn and soy products. We take great pride in loving these animals like pets until they make their ultimate sacrifice, to feed our families. Being a farmer is emotionally tolling, but the most rewarding and humbling experience. We all need to eat, and we should enjoy what we are putting into our bodies. You can rest assured that you are buying exceptional quality meat from a family that is doing this simply for the love of farming!</p>

 <p>Soon to The Butcherâ€™s Pantry, we will be offering breads, seasonal fruits and vegetables, pre-seasoned, grill-ready meats, as well as pre-made dinners â€” ready to toss in the oven (think seasoned vegetables, potatoes, and meat) for all those last-minute dinners!</p>

 <p><strong>Please note:</strong> we do have a $50 minimum for online orders and offer free delivery on orders over $250. We offer delivery throughout BC. Fill your cart, choose your pick-up type and desired date. We will do our best to make delivery as close to the requested date as possible. After you place your order, you will receive a confirmation email that will include an estimated total based on the average package size of your selected product.</p>

 <p><strong>PLEASE WAIT TO PAY YOUR INVOICE UNTIL YOU RECEIVE YOUR FINAL INVOICE FROM US.</strong> This will be emailed to you prior to your date of pick-up. For payments, you can pay via cash, e-transfer (directions below), Debit and Credit Card (not preferred). We know a lump sum of money can be difficult to come up with which is why we also offer payment plans. Our payment plans are fully customizable and can be altered to fit your individual budget.</p>

 <h2>Pick-Ups</h2>
 <p>Once we have a butcher date for your product, we can give you a ballpark time frame as to when to expect your order to be ready for pickup. As weather and other environmental conditions can affect growth rates or suitability for butcher, this date is not guaranteed â€” but we try to give as much notice as possible if there are any changes.</p>

 <h2>E-Transfer Directions</h2>
 <p>Send e-transfers to //<strong>email email email </strong>// â€“ there is autodeposit enabled. <strong>Be sure to note in the comments of the e-transfer what the order number is and the name on the order.</strong> We will do our best to track down payments that do not have the information, but that becomes incredibly difficult.</p>

 <p>Thank you for choosing to support your local farmers. We are doing our best to raise the next generation of farmers that love their animals, friends, family, communities, and healthy food!</p>
